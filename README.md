## Manual installation

### Requirements

* macOS 10.13.5 or later, with Xcode 10.0 beta or later; OR

  sources.

### Installation

Install the swift-jupyter kernel by following the "Installation Instructions
With TensorFlow toolchain" in the
[swift-jupyter readme](https://github.com/google/swift-jupyter). **The prebuilt
toolchains as of 2018-08-31 are not compatible with the tutorial. Please wait.
We will build new compatible toolchains shortly.**
